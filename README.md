# Engineering-Report
My company's engineering team tracks construction projects in ProjectMates and when they want to get reports they export this project data into a plain Excel file. In order to present this data in meetings they would have to spend time manually formatting the font, colors, and any data changes necessary every time a report was exported.

I was given the task of automating this formatting process. I was sent the SOP for how one of their reports was formatted and translated these steps into an Excel Macro. The script asks for the file path where the reports are located, opens each one matching the file name criteria, formats it according to the SOP, and saves the file.
